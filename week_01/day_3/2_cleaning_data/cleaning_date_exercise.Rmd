```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
video_games <- read_csv("data/steam-200k-sample.csv",
         skip = 4,
         col_types = cols('bought online' = col_logical()))
```
Can convert 'bought online' to logical

```{r}
video_games %>% 
  names()
```
```{r}
library(janitor)
```
```{r}
video_games_janitor_clean <- video_games %>%
  clean_names()
# replaces spaces with underscores, makes lowercase
video_games_janitor_clean %>% 
  names()
```

Alternatively we could rename manually with rename()
```{r}
video_games_renamed <- video_games_janitor_clean %>% 
  rename("game_title"= "game_name", "activity" = "what", "playing_hours" = "value")

video_games_renamed %>% 
  names()

```
