## Connecting R to a SQL Database

1. Storing Acess Credentials Securely

Two strategies for storing and using access credentials (when workinf in git)
  1. Don't store the credentials anywhere near the git repository e.g. not in the project folder but in home folder 
  2. Use a .gitignore file (i.e. don't want git to track our credentials file) - we'll do this one
  
Storing credentials within a repo but not tracking with git using a .gitignore file
  1. modify/create our gitignore to ignore the file `secrets.R`
  2. commit that changed gitignore
  3. add file with credentials `secrets.R`
  4. source `secrets.R` into script/notebook
